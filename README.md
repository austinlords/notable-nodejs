# Notable: A full-feature note-taking web application

## Built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB

Full-stack application is complete! This repository is the back-end only. You can find the front-end repository here: https://github.com/austinlords/notable. 

This web app will allow you to create rich-text notes. Add tags and collections to your notes for easy filtering. Your entire library is instantly searchable. 

You can view a live demo of the web app with dummy-data here: https://www.austinlords.com/notable. You can also login/register to create and save your own notes!
